                If you have a dispute with the Site, Site Content, or any
                products purchased through the Site, you hereby release us and
                our partners and service providers (and each party’s respective
                officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and
                employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and
                consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown,
                arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If
                you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code
                §1542, which states: “A general release does not extend to
                claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or
                suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing
                the release and that, if known by him or her, would have
                materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or
                released party.” <br /><br /><span class="table-title"
                  >General Terms</span
                ><br />
                These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other
                agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms,
                are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between
                you and Unapologetic Flex regarding your use of the Site. You
                may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under
                these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
                otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign
                these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure
                to require performance of any provision will not affect our
                right to require performance at any other time after that, nor
                will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or
                any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent
                breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of
                section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will
                not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision.
                Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means
                “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms is
                held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will
                be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the
                remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
                <br /><br /><span class="table-title">Legal Notices</span><br />
                These Terms are governed by the laws of the state of without
                regard to conflict of law principles. The exclusive jurisdiction
                and venue for any claims arising out of or related to these
                Terms or your use of the Site will lie in the state and federal
                courts located in undefined, undefined, and you irrevocably
                agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. The failure
                of Unapologetic Flex to enforce any right or provision in these
                Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision
                unless acknowledged and agreed to by Unapologetic Flex in
                writing. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction
                finds any provision of these Terms to be illegal, invalid or
                unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full
                force and effect.

                For quality issues, please provide clear photos of the products
                on a flat, well-lit surface. This quick and simple step will
                help us to provide a speedy resolution. Because products are

                All of our products are made to order especially for you. You
                can cancel or amend your order at any time before it is sent to
                production. In some cases, this could be as soon as two hours
                for Rush shipping, just 12 hours for standard shipping, or once
                the listing ends (whichever comes first). If the order has been
                sent to production, it means that our print partner is already
                working to produce it. Due to that, it may not be possible to
                cancel the order free of charge at this point. To check your
                order status, amend your order, edit the shipping address or
                cancel; please use the link provided in your confirmation email.
